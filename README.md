# 2-Roman-Numeral-Converter for FCC Javascript cert 2/5 final projects

Initial plan is to create a few if statements for number ranges. 
If less than 10 , if less than 100,if less than 1000, greater than 1000. 
Add the less than 1s at the end too. 
Lemme see how to split the number into 10s and remainders.
