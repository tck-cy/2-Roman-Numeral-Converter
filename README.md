# 2-Roman-Numeral-Converter for FCC Javascript cert 2/5 final projects

Initial plan is to create a few if statements for number ranges. 
If less than 10 , if less than 100,if less than 1000, greater than 1000. 
use the splitNumber function that will split the number into an array of ones, tens, hundreds and thousands. 
throw your if statements at the array to separate the numbers based on size and then we will need separate tensString and HundredsString etc.
